  ## Installation
  --Clone the repo and install the required packages via npm install. You'll need to use MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. Use the schema.sql file to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Run 'npm run seed' to seed data to the database in order to test the routes. 
  ## Usage
  --Type 'npm start' to be listening on the express server and use Postman to test your GET PUT CREATE DELETE routes.
